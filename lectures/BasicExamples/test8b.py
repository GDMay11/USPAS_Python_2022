#This is an alternate solution to problem 8

from test7 import x
import test7

#I can invoke test7.py to run the previous program, instead of typing it again. But first I need to initialize x.

print("test 7 complete.")

for lp in range(3):
 x = 2*x
 print("x: " + str(x))

#by default, multiplying a numpy array by a scalar will multiply each element by that scalar.
