1. Write a program that prints “Hello World”

2. Write a program that creates a variable ‘x = 1’, then prints ‘x’.

3. Write a program that creates a variable ‘x = 1’, sets ‘x’ to ‘x * 2’, then prints ‘x’.

4. Write a program that creates a variable ‘x = 1’, create for loop that iterations three times,
and each iteration it sets x to x *2, then prints ‘x’, then prints the loop variable ‘lp’.

5. Write a program that create a variable x =1, create while loop that iterates until x > 1000,
and each iteration it sets x to x *2, then prints ‘x’, then prints the number of loop iterations.

6. Write a program that imports numpy, then that checks if the square root of 65 is greater than 8, then prints “Yes!” if it is.

7. Write a program that imports numpy, creates a numpy array called ‘x’ of size 10 filled with zeros,
then create a loop that fills each value of that ‘x’ sequentially 1, 2, 3… etc, printing ‘x’ at every iteration.

8. Write a program that does 7, then create a loop that iterates three times,
and within that loop create another loop that multiplies each value of ‘x’ sequentially by 2,
and then after each inner loop within the outer loop print ‘x’.

9. Write a program that does 7, then create a numpy array called ‘sfin’ of size 10 filled with zeros.
Then create a loop that iterates until ‘sfin’ is filled with nonzero values,
and within that loop create a loop that multiples each value of ‘x’ sequentially by 2 if the corresponding value of ‘sfin’ is zero,
then within the inner loop if that value of ‘x’ is greater then 1000 sets the corresponding value of ‘sfin’ to the number of outer loop iterations (nonzero),
then after both loops complete prints ‘x’ and ‘sfin’.
