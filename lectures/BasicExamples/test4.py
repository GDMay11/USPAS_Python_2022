 print("x: " + str(x))
 print("lp: " + str(lp))

#This is called a 'for' loop, lp will take the value of each number in the set [0, 1, 2] and run the commands in the loop.
#The identation is important, it tells the python interpretter that all the commands are part of the loop.

#The str function can be used to convert a number into a character. Essentially, it 'writes out' the number.
#Using the + sign with two strings (of characters) concatenates them (smushes them together).
#In this way, we can combine text and numbers on the same line.
